# 📈 React Stock Chart Viewer

This is a simple, responsive React web application that reads a CSV file (`dump.csv`) containing stock market index data (e.g., Nifty 50, Nifty Next 50), displays a list of available companies on the sidebar, and generates interactive line charts when a company is selected.

The chart visualizes closing price trends over time using **Chart.js** via `react-chartjs-2`.


##  Features

-  Parses and loads CSV data using `papaparse`
-  Sidebar listing all available companies

-  Responsive layout using Bootstrap
-  Chart rendering via `Chart.js`
